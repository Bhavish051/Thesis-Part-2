<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Hello there!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.<br />
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.<br />
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
Below, is the sequence of past events: <br />
In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d4bab5b9b194b0bbb9b5bdbafab7bbb9">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.<br />
Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).<br />
All smart things are quite straightforward. (^^)<br />
<br />
The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.<br />
I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.<br />
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.<br />
My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.<br />
<br />
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...<br />
<br />
While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.<br />
You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.<br />
I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.<br />
<br />
If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.<br />
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.<br />
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.<br />
<br />
Let's resolve it like this:<br />
All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.<br />
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.<br />
<br />
That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.<br />
If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.<br />

<br />
Hello there!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.<br />
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.<br />
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
Below, is the sequence of past events:<br />
In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9de5e5e5e5dde4e4e4e4b3fef2f0">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.<br />
Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).<br />
All smart things are quite straightforward. (^^)<br />
<br />
The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.<br />
I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.<br />
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.<br />
My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.<br />
<br />
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...<br />
<br />
While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.<br />
You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.<br />
I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.<br />
<br />
If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.<br />
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.<br />
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.<br />
<br />
Let's resolve it like this:<br />
All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.<br />
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.<br />
<br />
That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.<br />
If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.<br />
<br />
Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1CiqhHbPPNKHyX9AiMBFKp6ydxcM5WJyBW<br />
<br />
You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).<br />
<br />
Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:<br />
> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).<br />
> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.<br />
> Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.<br />
> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:<br />
> That I will not receive the money you transferred.<br />
- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).<br />
> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.<br />
- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!<br />
<br />
Everything will be carried out based on fairness!<br />
<br />
Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!<br />
An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.<br />
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.<br />
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
Below, is the sequence of past events:<br />
In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours.<br />
<br />
A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.<br />
Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).<br />
All smart things are quite straightforward. (^^)<br />
<br />
The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.<br />
I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.<br />
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.<br />
My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.<br />
<br />
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...<br />
<br />
While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.<br />
You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.<br />
I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.<br />
<br />
If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.<br />
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.<br />
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.<br />
<br />
Let's resolve it like this:<br />
All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.<br />
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.<br />
<br />
That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.<br />

Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).<br />
Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.<br />
Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.<br />
Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:<br />
That I will not receive the money you transferred.<br />
- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).<br />
That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.<br />
- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!<br />

Everything will be carried out based on fairness!<br />

Hello there!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.<br />
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.<br />
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
Below, is the sequence of past events:<br />
In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="59212121211920202020773a3634">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.<br />
Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).<br />
All smart things are quite straightforward. (^^)<br />
<br />
The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.<br />
I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.<br />
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.<br />
My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.<br />
<br />
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...<br />
<br />
While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.<br />
You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.<br />
I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.<br />
<br />
If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.<br />
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.<br />
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.<br />
<br />
Let's resolve it like this:<br />
All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.<br />
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.<br />
<br />
That is quite a fair deal with a low price, bearing in mind that I have spent a lot of effort to go through your profile and traffic for a long period.<br />
If you are unaware how to buy and send bitcoins - it can be easily fixed by searching all related information online.<br />

<br />
You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).<br />
<br />
Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:<br />

> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately.<br />

- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!<br />
<br />

Hello there!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are some bad news for you.<br />
Around several months ago I have obtained access to your devices that you were using to browse internet.<br />
Subsequently, I have proceeded with tracking down internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
Below, is the sequence of past events: In the past, I have bought access from hackers to numerous email accounts (today, that is a very straightforward task that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I have effortlessly logged in to email account of yours <br />
<br />
A week after that, I have managed to install Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all your devices that are used for email access.<br />
Actually, that was quite simple (because you were clicking the links in inbox emails).<br />
All smart things are quite straightforward. (^^)<br />
<br />
The software of mine allows me to access to all controllers in your devices, such as video camera, microphone and keyboard.<br />
I have managed to download all your personal data, as well as web browsing history and photos to my servers.<br />
I can access all messengers of yours, as well as emails, social networks, contacts list and even chat history.<br />
My virus unceasingly refreshes its signatures (since it is driver-based), and hereby stays invisible for your antivirus.<br />
<br />
So, by now you should already understand the reason why I remained unnoticed until this very moment...<br />
<br />
While collecting your information, I have found out that you are also a huge fan of websites for adults.<br />
You truly enjoy checking out porn websites and watching dirty videos, while having a lot of kinky fun.<br />
I have recorded several kinky scenes of yours and montaged some videos, where you reach orgasms while passionately masturbating.<br />
<br />
If you still doubt my serious intentions, it only takes couple mouse clicks to share your videos with your friends, relatives and even colleagues.<br />
It is also not a problem for me to allow those vids for access of public as well.<br />
I truly believe, you would not want this to occur, understanding how special are the videos you love watching, (you are clearly aware of that) all that stuff can result in a real disaster for you.<br />
<br />
Let's resolve it like this:<br />
All you need is $1350 USD transfer to my account (bitcoin equivalent based on exchange rate during your transfer), and after the transaction is successful, I will proceed to delete all that kinky stuff without delay.<br />
Afterwards, we can pretend that we have never met before. In addition, I assure you that all the harmful software will be deleted from all your devices. Be sure, I keep my promises.<br />
<br />

<br />
Below is bitcoin wallet of mine: 1CiqhHbPPNKHyX9AiMBFKp6ydxcM5WJyBW<br />
<br />
You are given not more than 48 hours after you have opened this email (2 days to be precise).<br />
<br />
Below is the list of actions that you should not attempt doing:<br />
> Do not attempt to reply my email (the email in your inbox was created by me together with return address).<br />
> Do not attempt to call police or any other security services. Moreover, don't even think to share this with friends of yours. Once I find that out (make no doubt about it, I can do that effortlessly, bearing in mind that I have full control over all your systems) - the video of yours will become available to public immediately. Do not attempt to search for me - there is completely no point in that. All cryptocurrency transactions remain anonymous at all times.<br />
> Do not attempt reinstalling the OS on devices of yours or get rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your videos are already available at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Below is the list of things you don't need to be concerned about:<br />
> That I will not receive the money you transferred.<br />
- Don't you worry, I can still track it, after the transaction is successfully completed, because I still monitor all your activities (trojan virus of mine includes a remote-control option, just like TeamViewer).<br />
> That I still will make your videos available to public after your money transfer is complete.<br />
- Believe me, it is meaningless for me to keep on making your life complicated. If I indeed wanted to make it happen, it would happen long time ago!<br />
Everything will be carried out based on fairness!<br />
<br />
Before I forget...moving forward try not to get involved in this kind of situations anymore!<br />
An advice from me - regularly change all the passwords to your accounts.<br />
