<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Hello!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant news for you.<br />
Roughly several months ago I have managed to get a complete access to all devices that you use to browse internet.<br />
Afterwards, I have proceeded with monitoring all internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
You can check out the sequence of events summarize below: <br />
Previously I have bought from hackers a special access to various email accounts (currently, it is rather a straightforward thing that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I could effortlessly log in to your email account as well (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3d5c505c4f4c48584949585a485c515c7d495c4f5a5849545349584f53584913535849">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week after that, I proceeded with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all your devices, which are used by you to login to your email.<br />
Actually, that was rather a simple thing to do (because you have opened a few links from your inbox emails previously).<br />
Genius is in simplicity. ( ~_^)<br />
<br />
Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).<br />
I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.<br />
I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.<br />
This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...<br />
<br />
While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.<br />
You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.<br />
To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.<br />
<br />
If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.<br />
In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.<br />
I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.<br />
<br />
We can still resolve it in the following manner:<br />
You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.<br />
Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.<br />
<br />
It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.<br />
If you still unaware about the purchase and transfer process of bitcoins - all you can do is find the necessary information online.<br />
<br />
My bitcoin wallet is as follows: 1LzA9kzQkGDTYSfbbLE8gK5RAJ5ke32ntC<br />
<br />
You are left with 48 hours and the countdown starts right after you open this email (2 days to be specific).<br />
<br />
Don't forget to keep in mind and abstain from doing the following:<br />
> Do not attempt to reply my email (this email was generated in your inbox together with the return address).<br />
> Do not attempt to call police as well as other security services. Moreover, don't even think of sharing it with your friends. If I get to know about it (based on my skills, that would be very easy, since that I have all your systems under my control and constant monitoring) - your dirty video will become public without delay. <br />
> Don't attempt searching for me - it is completely useless. Cryptocurrency transactions always remain anonymous.<br />
> Don't attempt reinstalling the OS of your devices or even getting rid of them. It is meaningless too, because all your private videos are already been available on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you should be concerned about:<br />
> That I will not receive the funds transfer you make.<br />
Relax, I will be able to track it immediately, after you complete the funds transfer, because I unceasingly monitor all activities that you do (trojan virus of mine can control remotely all processes, same as TeamViewer).<br />
> That I will still distribute your videos after you have sent the money to me. <br />
Believe me, it is pointless for me to proceed with troubling you after that. Besides that, if that really was my intention, it would happen long time ago! <br />
<br />
It all will be settled on fair conditions and terms!<br />
<br />
One last advice from me... Moving forward make sure you don't get involved in such type of incidents again!<br />
My suggestion - make sure you change all your passwords as often as possible.<br />

Hello!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant news for you.<br />
Roughly several months ago I have managed to get a complete access to all devices that you use to browse internet.<br />
Afterwards, I have proceeded with monitoring all internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
You can check out the sequence of events summarize below:<br />
Previously I have bought from hackers a special access to various email accounts (currently, it is rather a straightforward thing that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I could effortlessly log in to your email account as well (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4120252c282f01383838386f222e2c">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week after that, I proceeded with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all your devices, which are used by you to login to your email.<br />
Actually, that was rather a simple thing to do (because you have opened a few links from your inbox emails previously).<br />
Genius is in simplicity. ( ~_^)<br />
<br />
Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).<br />
I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.<br />
I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.<br />
This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...<br />
<br />
While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.<br />
You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.<br />
To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.<br />
<br />
If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.<br />
In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.<br />
I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.<br />
<br />
We can still resolve it in the following manner:<br />
You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.<br />
Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word .<br />
<br />
It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.<br />

<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Hello!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have some unpleasant news for you.<br />
Roughly several months ago I have managed to get a complete access to all devices that you use to browse internet.<br />
Afterwards, I have proceeded with monitoring all internet activities of yours.<br />
<br />
You can check out the sequence of events summarize below: <br />
Previously I have bought from hackers a special access to various email accounts (currently, it is rather a straightforward thing that can be done online).<br />
Clearly, I could effortlessly log in to your email account as well (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="99f7f8f7edfaf6f4d9faf6ebfceaf1f8ebe9b7f7fced">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week after that, I proceeded with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all your devices, which are used by you to login to your email.<br />
Actually, that was rather a simple thing to do (because you have opened a few links from your inbox emails previously).<br />
Genius is in simplicity. ( ~_^)<br />
<br />
Thanks to that software I can get access to all controllers inside your devices (such as your video camera, microphone, keyboard etc.).<br />
I could easily download all your data, photos, web browsing history and other information to my servers.<br />
I can access all your social networks accounts, messengers, emails, including chat history as well as contacts list.<br />
This virus of mine unceasingly keeps refreshing its signatures (since it is controlled by a driver), and as result stays unnoticed by antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Hereby, I believe by this time it is already clear for you why I was never detected until I sent this letter...<br />
<br />
While compiling all the information related to you, I have also found out that you are a true fan and frequent visitor of adult websites.<br />
You truly enjoy browsing through porn websites, while watching arousing videos and experiencing an unimaginable satisfaction.<br />
To be honest, I could not resist but to record some of your kinky solo sessions and compiled them in several videos, which demonstrate you masturbating and cumming in the end.<br />
<br />
If you still don't trust me, all it takes me is several mouse clicks to distribute all those videos with your colleagues, friends and even relatives.<br />
In addition, I can upload them online for entire public to access.<br />
I truly believe, you absolutely don't want such things to occur, bearing in mind the kinky stuff exposed in those videos that you usually watch, (you definitely understand what I am trying to say) it will result in a complete disaster for you.<br />
<br />
We can still resolve it in the following manner:<br />
You perform a transfer of $1590 USD to me (a bitcoin equivalent based on the exchange rate during the funds transfer), so after I receive the transfer, I will straight away remove all those lecherous videos without hesitation.<br />
Then we can pretend like it has never happened before. In addition, I assure that all the harmful software will be deactivated and removed from all devices of yours. Don't worry, I am a man of my word.<br />
<br />
It is really a good deal with a considerably low the price, bearing in mind that I was monitoring your profile as well as traffic over an extended period.<br />
