                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="bbc3c3c3c3fbc2c2c2c295d8d4d6"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="601818181820191919194e030f0d"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account ([email address only used for spam reporting!!!]).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you,<br />
                                                I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,<br />
                                                and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know,<br />
                                                including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos,<br />
                                                (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
                                                for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer),<br />
                                                hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all
                                                those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about,<br />
                                                because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price,<br />
                                                taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
                                                monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />

                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) -<br />
                                                your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />

                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished,<br />
                                                I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities
                                                done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
                                                TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                            <div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference: <br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="1d65656565656565655d736f7c7233787968"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you,<br />
                                                I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,<br />
                                                and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know,<br />
                                                including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos,<br />
                                                (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity
                                                for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer),<br />
                                                hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all
                                                those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about,<br />
                                                because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price,<br />
                                                taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close
                                                monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - <br />
                                                your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away. <br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw them away. That won't solve the issue, <br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished,<br />
                                                I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities
                                                done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as
                                                TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet. <br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier! <br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="522a2a2a2a122b2b2b2b7c313d3f"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="522a2a2a2a122b2b2b2b7c313d3f"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="d4acacacac94adadadadfab7bbb9"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="542c2c2c2c142d2d2d2d7a373b39"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />

                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid

                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously

                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to

                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="a0d8d8d8d8e0d9d9d9d98ec3cfcd"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="bfc7c7c7c7ffc6c6c6c691dcd0d2"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="552d2d2d2d152c2c2c2c7b363a38"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />

                                                All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is
                                                opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                The following list includes things you should remember and avoid
                                                doing:<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and
                                                return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security
                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />

                                                <br />
                                                Hi there!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
                                                Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access
                                                to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
                                                Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on
                                                continuous basis.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for
                                                your reference:<br />
                                                Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of
                                                email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which
                                                can arranged via internet).<br />
                                                Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email
                                                account (<a class="__cf_email__"
                                                    data-cfemail="037b7b7b7b437a7a7a7a2d606c6e"
                                                    href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>).<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in
                                                Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
                                                Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you
                                                were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails
                                                before).<br />
                                                Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of
                                                controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone
                                                and others).<br />
                                                As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web
                                                browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
                                                Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you
                                                regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers,
                                                contacts list etc.<br />
                                                My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control
                                                by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of
                                                antiviruses.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always
                                                remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
                                                <br />
                                                During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with
                                                you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of
                                                websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
                                                Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as
                                                watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
                                                As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to
                                                record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later
                                                produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming
                                                scenes.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to
                                                make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends,
                                                colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
                                                Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone
                                                to see.<br />
                                                I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take
                                                place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly
                                                watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause
                                                a huge adversity for you.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to
                                                do:<br />
                                                You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in
                                                bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of
                                                funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately
                                                get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
                                                After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening
                                                beforehand.<br />
                                                Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be
                                                disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to
                                                worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced
                                                price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were
                                                under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
                                                If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions
                                                with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />

                                                services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any
                                                of your friends.<br />
                                                If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be
                                                really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously
                                                monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight
                                                away.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any
                                                success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and
                                                untraceable.<br />
                                                &gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to
                                                throw<br />
                                                &gt; them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
                                                since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on
                                                remote servers.<br />
                                                <br />
                                                Things that may be concerning you:<br />
                                                &gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
                                                Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds
                                                transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track
                                                down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes
                                                remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
                                                &gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have
                                                completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
                                                Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money
                                                transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I
                                                would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
                                                <br />
                                                In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you
                                                need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of
                                                unpleasant events anymore!<br />
                                                My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones
                                                on a regular basis.<br />
