<br />
Hi there!<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:<br />
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).<br />
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="423a3a3a3a023b3b3b3b6c212d2f">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).<br />
Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
<br />
Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).<br />
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.<br />
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
<br />
During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.<br />
<br />
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.<br />
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.<br />
<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw<br />
> them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />

Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).<br />
Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
<br />
Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).<br />
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.<br />
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
<br />
During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you,<br />
I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role,<br />
and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.<br />
<br />
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know,<br />
including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.<br />
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos,<br />
(you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.<br />
<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer),<br />
hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about,<br />
because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,<br />
taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) -<br />
your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,<br />
I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />

<br />
Hi there!<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:<br />
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).<br />
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a323232320a3333333364292527">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).<br />
Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
<br />
Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).<br />
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.<br />
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
<br />
During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.<br />
<br />
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.<br />
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.<br />
<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw<br />
> them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />

<br />
Hi there!<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:<br />
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).<br />
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1a626262625a6363636334797577">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).<br />
Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
<br />
Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).<br />
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.<br />
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
<br />
During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.<br />
<br />
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.<br />
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.<br />
<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw<br />
> them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />

Hi there!<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:<br />

<br />
Hi there!<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you about some sad news for you.<br />
Approximately a month or two ago I have succeeded to gain a total access to all your devices utilized for browsing internet.<br />
Moving forward, I have started observing your internet activities on continuous basis.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and take a look at the sequence of events provided below for your reference:<br />
Initially I bought an exclusive access from hackers to a long list of email accounts (in today's world, that is really a common thing, which can arranged via internet).<br />
Evidently, it wasn't hard for me to proceed with logging in your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ceb6b6b6b68eb7b7b7b7e0ada1a3">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
Within the same week, I moved on with installing a Trojan virus in Operating Systems for all devices that you use to login to email.<br />
Frankly speaking, it wasn't a challenging task for me at all (since you were kind enough to click some of the links in your inbox emails before).<br />
Yeah, geniuses are among us.<br />
<br />
Because of this Trojan I am able to gain access to entire set of controllers in devices (e.g., your video camera, keyboard, microphone and others).<br />
As result, I effortlessly downloaded all data, as well as photos, web browsing history and other types of data to my servers.<br />
Moreover, I have access to all social networks accounts that you regularly use, including emails, including chat history, messengers, contacts list etc.<br />
My unique virus is incessantly refreshing its signatures (due to control by a driver), and hence remains undetected by any type of antiviruses.<br />
<br />
Hence, I guess by now you can already see the reason why I always remained undetected until this very letter...<br />
<br />
During the process of compilation of all the materials associated with you, I also noticed that you are a huge supporter and regular user of websites hosting nasty adult content.<br />
Turns out to be, you really love visiting porn websites, as well as watching exciting videos and enduring unforgettable pleasures.<br />
As a matter of fact, I was not able to withstand the temptation, but to record certain nasty solo action with you in main role, and later produced a few videos exposing your masturbation and cumming scenes.<br />
<br />
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is one-two mouse clicks to make all those videos with everyone you know, including your friends, colleagues, relatives and others.<br />
Moreover, I am able to upload all that video content online for everyone to see.<br />
I sincerely think, you certainly would not wish such incidents to take place, in view of the lustful things demonstrated in your commonly watched videos, (you absolutely know what I mean by that) it will cause a huge adversity for you.<br />
<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw<br />
> them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />

<br />
There is still a solution to this matter, and here is what you need to do:<br />
You make a transaction of $1340 USD to my account (an equivalent in bitcoins, which recorded depending on the exchange rate at the date of funds transfer), hence upon receiving the transfer, I will immediately get rid of all those lustful videos without delay.<br />
After that we can make it look like there was nothing happening beforehand.<br />
Additionally, I can confirm that all the Trojan software is going to be disabled and erased from all devices that you use. You have nothing to worry about, because I keep my word at all times.<br />
<br />
That is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.<br />
If you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.<br />
<br />
Below is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 16bHkVFULVmxTGVi2XKpwzkt5KrRnThzPg<br />
<br />
All you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).<br />
<br />
The following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:<br />
> There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).<br />
> There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.<br />
If I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them) - your nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.<br />
> There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.<br />
> There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw<br />
> them away. That won't solve the issue,<br />
since all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things that may be concerning you:<br />
> That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.<br />
Breathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished, I will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).<br />
> That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.<br />
Trust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!<br />
<br />
We are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!<br />
My recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.<br />
