<br/>
I have to share bad news with you.<br/>
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br/>
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the sequence of events:<br/>
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br/>
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account.<br/>
<br/>
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br/>
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br/>
All ingenious is simple. =)<br/>
<br/>
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br/>
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br/>
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br/>
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br/>
<br/>
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br/>
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br/>
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br/>
<br/>
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br/>
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br/>
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's settle it this way:<br/>
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br/>
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br/>
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1xPr18gM8YKsaiUkGz9MgpjtwcBQcME2i<br/>
<br/>
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br/>
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br/>
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br/>
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br/>
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br/>
<br/>
Things you don't need to worry about:<br/>
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br/>
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br/>
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br/>
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br/>
<br/>
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br/>
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis</br></div>], [], [<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div"><br/>

You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br/>
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br/>
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. <br/>
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br/>
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br/>
<br/>
Things you don't need to worry about:<br/>
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br/>
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br/>
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br/>
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago! <br/>

Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br/>

You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br/>
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br/>
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br/>
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br/>
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br/>
<br/>
Things you don't need to worry about:<br/>
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br/>
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br/>
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br/>
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br/>
<br/>
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br/>
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br/>

<br/>
I have to share bad news with you.<br/>
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br/>
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the sequence of events:<br/>
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br/>
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account.<br/>
<br/>
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br/>
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br/>
All ingenious is simple. =)<br/>
<br/>
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br/>
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br/>
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br/>
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br/>
<br/>
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br/>
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br/>
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br/>
<br/>
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br/>
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br/>
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's settle it this way:<br/>
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br/>
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br/>
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br/>

One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br/>
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br/>
All ingenious is simple. =)<br/>
<br/>
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br/>
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br/>
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br/>
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br/>
<br/>
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br/>
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br/>
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br/>
<br/>
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br/>
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br/>
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's settle it this way:<br/>
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br/>
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br/>
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br/>
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br/>
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br/>
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br/>
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br/>
<br/>
Things you don't need to worry about:<br/>
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br/>
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br/>
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br/>
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br/>
<br/>
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br/>
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br/>

You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br/>
<br/>
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br/>
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br/>
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. <br/>
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br/>
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br/>
<br/>
Things you don't need to worry about:<br/>
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br/>
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br/>
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br/>
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago! <br/>
<br/>
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br/>
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br/>

<br/>
I have to share bad news with you.<br/>
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br/>
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the sequence of events: <br/>
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br/>
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (-).<br/>
<br/>
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br/>
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br/>
All ingenious is simple. =)<br/>
<br/>
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br/>
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br/>
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br/>
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br/>
<br/>
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br/>
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br/>
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br/>
<br/>
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br/>
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br/>
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br/>
<br/>
Let's settle it this way:<br/>
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br/>
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br/>
