If any hosting service is providing or hosting this wallet address do not block or cancel, only monitor access to obtain a fresh source IP address and notify and cooperate with the authorities. Be aware this kind of thing lowers the value of bitcoin and hurts your bottom line so anything you can do to bring this sad and pathetic fuckwad to justice will help your own profits.<br />
I honestly have a hard time believing that there are people smart enough to use a computer who think this kind of thing is worth it in the end. So you think that some cut and paste bullshit scam that won't get you anything at all is worth having an Interpol warrant for your arrest? Even if you got a couple of dollars/euros you're going to have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your miserable excuse of a life. Really? Do you really think the scammer who sold you the 'cloud powered' bitcoin scam can really hide your identity? How mentally deficit are you? Do you dress yourself when you get out of bed? Can you wipe your own ass? From the fact you fell for a dogshit bitcoin get rich quick scheme like this it looks like that's as far in life as you have managed to get.<br />

and the time of mailing (both in the header) a law agency could (possibly<br />
by mapping date/time & connections) trace the email back to the originator.<br />

Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events:<br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a323232320a3333333364292527">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. ;)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $1650 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br />
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br />
<br />
Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1ND3JTwUaYWhDjTuaAK8idmpmuRQGqAkB1<br />
<br />
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br />
<br />
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br />
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br />
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br />
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br />
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you don't need to worry about:<br />
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br />
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br />
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br />
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br />
<br />
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br />
<br />
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br />
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br />
<br />

<br />
Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events:<br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7b1a1f1612153b0202020255181416">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. ;)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $1650 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br />
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br />
<br />
Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1ND3JTwUaYWhDjTuaAK8idmpmuRQGqAkB1<br />
<br />
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br />
<br />
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br />
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br />
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br />
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br />
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you don't need to worry about:<br />
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br />
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br />
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br />
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br />
<br />
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br />
<br />
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br />
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br />
<br />
