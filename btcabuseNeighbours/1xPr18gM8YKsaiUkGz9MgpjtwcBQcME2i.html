<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events:<br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account.<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. =)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br />
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br />

<br />
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br />
<br />
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br />
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br />
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away.<br />
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br />
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you don't need to worry about:<br />
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br />
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br />
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br />
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago!<br />
<br />
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br />
<br />
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br />
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis</div>

Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events: <br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ef979797af979797c18c8082">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. =)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />

<div class="col-md-11 srtr_div">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events: <br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2f4c434a424a415b6f475a594a5b014c4042">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. =)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br />
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br />
<br />
Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1xPr18gM8YKsaiUkGz9MgpjtwcBQcME2i<br />
<br />
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br />
<br />
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br />
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br />
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. <br />
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br />
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you don't need to worry about:<br />
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br />
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br />
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br />
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago! <br />
<br />
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br />
<br />
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br />
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis</div>

Subject: Payment from your account. <br />
<br />
Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have to share bad news with you.<br />
Approximately few months ago I have gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.<br />
After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.<br />
<br />
Here is the sequence of events: <br />
Some time ago I have purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to purchase such thing online).<br />
Obviously, I have easily managed to log in to your email account (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="751e191a05100f35011a181706011a1b105b1e44475b140f5b0006">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br />
<br />
One week later, I have already installed Trojan virus to Operating Systems of all the devices that you use to access your email.<br />
In fact, it was not really hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails).<br />
All ingenious is simple. =)<br />
<br />
This software provides me with access to all the controllers of your devices (e.g., your microphone, video camera and keyboard).<br />
I have downloaded all your information, data, photos, web browsing history to my servers.<br />
I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contacts list.<br />
My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based), and hence remains invisible for antivirus software.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter...<br />
<br />
While gathering information about you, I have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites.<br />
You really love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos, while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure.<br />
Well, I have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show the way you masturbate and reach orgasms.<br />
<br />
If you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse and all your videos will be shared to your friends, colleagues and relatives.<br />
I have also no issue at all to make them available for public access.<br />
I guess, you really don't want that to happen, considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch, (you perfectly know what I mean) it will cause a true catastrophe for you.<br />
<br />
Let's settle it this way:<br />
You transfer $950 USD to me (in bitcoin equivalent according to the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away.<br />
After that we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me, I keep my word.<br />
<br />
This is a fair deal and the price is quite low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now.<br />
In case, if you don't know how to purchase and transfer the bitcoins - you can use any modern search engine.<br />
<br />
Here is my bitcoin wallet: 1xPr18gM8YKsaiUkGz9MgpjtwcBQcME2i<br />
<br />
You have less than 48 hours from the moment you opened this email (precisely 2 days).<br />
<br />
Things you need to avoid from doing:<br />
*Do not reply me (I have created this email inside your inbox and generated the return address).<br />
*Do not try to contact police and other security services. In addition, forget about telling this to you friends. If I discover that (as you can see, it is really not so hard, considering that I control all your systems) - your video will be shared to public right away. <br />
*Don't try to find me - it is absolutely pointless. All the cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.<br />
*Don't try to reinstall the OS on your devices or throw them away. It is pointless as well, since all the videos have already been saved at remote servers.<br />
<br />
Things you don't need to worry about:<br />
*That I won't be able to receive your funds transfer.<br />
- Don't worry, I will see it right away, once you complete the transfer, since I continuously track all your activities (my trojan virus has got a remote-control feature, something like TeamViewer).<br />
*That I will share your videos anyway after you complete the funds transfer.<br />
- Trust me, I have no point to continue creating troubles in your life. If I really wanted that, I would do it long time ago! <br />
<br />
Everything will be done in a fair manner!<br />
<br />
One more thing... Don't get caught in similar kind of situations anymore in future!<br />
My advice - keep changing all your passwords on a frequent basis<br />
